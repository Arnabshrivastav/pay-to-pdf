# pay-to-pdf

Goal : Build an application that generates payment details in PDF format after every successfull payment.
Currently, the application is taking in inputs like name and email id only. Following which the user is directed to a payment window where they can choose from a variety of payment options like netbanking, wallets, cards etc.
On the completion of payment, the application builds a pdf having name and email entered as by the user.
Inviting the open source community to work on additional functionalities. Also look into the issues listed. 

Happy Coding :)
